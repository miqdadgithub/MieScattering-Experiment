# Mie Scattering 
buliding a cost-efficient experiment, using 3D printing and embedded computing (Arduino Uno), which is capable of measuring Mie scattering on monodisperse particle suspensions quantitatively with high precision.
the original idea is from [Mie Scattering experiment](http://www.mss.cbi.fau.de/Mie-experiment/)
